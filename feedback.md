# MediaRanker Revisted
## What We're Looking For

<!--

What did you need to configure and setup to make OAuth installed and work?
  - Gemfile, env, initializers (if this includes routes, controller files, etc, or any of the below files, that's okay)

What areas of Rails app code did you need to create/write/modify in order to change logging in to use OAuth?
  - Routes, controllers, models, views (if this includes migrations, tests, etc, or any of the above files, that's okay)

What was one edge case you tested? How did this differ from the nominal case?
  - Anything reasonable, use best judgment

Why did we need to mock OAuth for testing?
  - To avoid using the GitHub as a dependency
  - Anything concrete about reducing risk around using actual GitHub accounts, resources, reducing complexity, etc. is fine too

NOTES ABOUT TESTS:
At project time, we give them:
44 tests, 140 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 4 skips
At project submission, we expect more tests/assertions, and 0 skips
